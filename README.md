# WhatsApp POC

This project demonstrates how to log in to WhatsApp Web using [`whatsapp-web.js`](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) and list all your chats.

## Setup

1. Install Node.js (>=14) if not already installed.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running

Run the script with:

```bash
node index.js
```

When the QR code appears in the terminal, scan it with the WhatsApp app on your phone. After successful authentication, the script will print "Client is ready!" and list your chat names.
